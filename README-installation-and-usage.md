# Install

1. Clone this repository or simply grab the python file
2. Install chez scheme and make sure it's on your
   path by running `chez`.
   - This could definitely work with other lisps or schemes,
     and you'd just have to modify one line of code to do so

# Run

I think a nice way to interactively run programs is with jupyter.
So, I recommend opening up a jupyter notebook. 
Simply 

# Example hindent code
