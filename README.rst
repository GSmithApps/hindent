====
ToDo
====

- [ ] redo the example code for map
- [ ] change the verbage from ``translate`` to something else. I can't think
      of what. It's hard to say. really all it does is remove comments and whitespace
      then add parenthesis.
- [ ] maybe get it out of running as a subprocess so
      it returns things more easily
- [ ] push to conda (in addition to pypi)
