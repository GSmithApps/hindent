Installation and Usage
======================

Installation
------------

1. ``pip install hindent``
2. The syntax highlighter for vs code is
   `Hindent Lang <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GrantSmith.hindent-lang>`_.  You can find
   it in the normal extensions menu / marketplace.

Usage
-----

I think a nice way to interactively run programs is with jupyter.
So, I recommend opening up a jupyter notebook. Then, simply start to
import ``Hindent`` with ``import hindent as h``, and the docstrings/code-hover
will guide you from there.
